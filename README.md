# My Portfolio Version 1
    This portfolio was inspired by many other portfolio in the web but mostly inspired by https://github.com/said7388/developer-portfolio.git.
    Then I added my own spin and design to add my own style and a bit of my self. Enjoy :).
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
